- Describe when/how often you will transmit these beacons.

- Discuss the idea of using RSSI as a proxy for distance and give examples of where it could go wrong.

- Is RSSI a good proxy for distance in this rescue use case?

## Part 2: Secret Key Exchange

### Calculate a key on each device (2 points)

- Discuss reasonable values for z (the number of standard deviations).

- Confirm resulting key (2 points)

- Describe how bits should be included in a cryptographic key that will serve as a basis for long-term secure communication.

- Show evidence both devices independently computed the same key.
